                <h3>Job Description</h3>
                <p>
                    A security analyst's job revolves around data and network protection. By staying informed about
                    changes in this fast-evolving field, these professionals can protect their companies' digital
                    assets. While keeping up with the changes can be a challenge, it may also add excitement.<br />
                    Information security analysts may work with executives, IT teams, and colleagues across their
                    organizations. They establish company security protocols, sometimes training employees about best
                    practices. They conduct tests to search for system weaknesses. They also develop response plans in
                    case of a breach.<br />
                    Aside from the challenge of staying up to date with current technology, information security
                    analysts may sometimes deal with stressful situations if a cyberattack does occur.
                    The section below discusses key skills that can influence success for information security
                    analysts.<br />

            <div class="specifications">
                <h3>Required Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Software and Technology:</b> Important tools for information security analysts include various
                    databases along with software for development, programming, network monitoring, and virus
                    protection. Security analysts need to know industry-standard programs like Blackboard, Apache Ant,
                    Symantec, and Django.<br />
                    <b>Computer Science:</b> A solid understanding of computer science principles should underpin
                    security analysts' work. They regularly deal with both hardware and software systems. They must also
                    write code to prevent and respond to cyberattacks.<br />
                    <b>Engineering and Electronics:</b> Information security analysts need to understand how their
                    organizations use technology. They need a strong working knowledge of how technology and networks
                    function so they can solve problems effectively.<br />
                    <b></b>Management:</b> Often leading IT teams, information security analysts need good
                    administration skills. They must develop, present, and monitor plans and protocols. They may also
                    oversee departmental budgets.
